## Verified Correct Imports

The following imports were verified and are correct:
- ✅ `from components.accessibility import AccessibilityManager, create_accessible_dashboard_layout`
- ✅ `from components.economic_insights import EconomicInsights`
- ✅ `from components.ui.metric_card import render_metric_card`
- ✅ `from components.ui.theme import ThemeManager`

## Root Cause

The import errors occurred because:
1. Class names in the files didn't match the names being imported
2. Likely due to refactoring where class names were changed but imports weren't updated

## Status

✅ All import fixes have been applied to:
- `/home/rcasa/AI-Adoption-Dashboard/app.py`
- `/mnt/c/Users/rcasa/OneDrive/Documents/AI-Adoption-Dashboard/app.py`

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes in GitHub Desktop
2. Push to GitHub
3. Streamlit will automatically redeploy
4. Monitor for any additional import errors

## Prevention

To prevent future import errors:
1. Always update imports when renaming classes
2. Run `python -m py_compile app.py` locally before pushing
3. Use consistent naming conventions
