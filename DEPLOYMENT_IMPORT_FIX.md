# Streamlit Deployment Import Error Fix

## Issue
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'CompetitiveAssessor' from 'components.competitive_assessor'
```

## Root Cause
- app.py was trying to import `CompetitiveAssessor`
- The actual class name in the file is `CompetitivePositionAssessor`

## Fix Applied
Changed the import in app.py from:
```python
from components.competitive_assessor import CompetitiveAssessor
```

To:
```python
from components.competitive_assessor import CompetitivePositionAssessor as CompetitiveAssessor
```

## Status
âœ… Fix applied to both:
- `/home/rcasa/AI-Adoption-Dashboard/app.py`
- `/mnt/c/Users/rcasa/OneDrive/Documents/AI-Adoption-Dashboard/app.py`

## Next Steps
1. Commit this change in GitHub Desktop
2. Push to GitHub
3. Streamlit will automatically redeploy
4. The import error should be resolved

## Additional Notes
This was a simple naming mismatch. The import alias ensures backward compatibility if the name `CompetitiveAssessor` is used elsewhere in the code.
