# Development Progress - Economics of AI Dashboard

## Phase 1: Data Architecture - COMPLETED ✓

### What Was Accomplished:

1. **Created Modular Data Architecture**
   - Base data loader interface (`data/loaders/base.py`)
   - PDF extraction framework (`data/extractors/base.py`)
   - Data models with Pydantic validation (`data/models/`)
   - Centralized data manager (`data/data_manager.py`)

2. **Implemented AI Index Loader**
   - Stanford HAI AI Index Report 2025 loader
   - Structured data extraction (ready for PDF parsing)
   - Complete dataset generation matching dashboard needs

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Created `dashboard_integration.py` to maintain app.py compatibility
   - All 25 datasets mapped to new architecture
   - Fallback mechanism for gradual migration

4. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added PDF processing libraries to requirements.txt
   - PyPDF2, pdfplumber, tabula-py, camelot-py

### Key Architecture Benefits:
- **Modularity**: Each data source has its own loader
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently  
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new data sources
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity

### Next Steps:
1. Install PDF dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Implement remaining loaders (McKinsey, OECD, Federal Reserve)
3. Extract actual data from PDF documents
4. Update app.py to use new data loading system
