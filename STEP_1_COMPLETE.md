# Step 1 Complete: Clean App.py Imports

## What Was Done

### Removed Unused Imports:
1. ❌ `from components.competitive_assessor import CompetitivePositionAssessor as CompetitiveAssessor`
2. ❌ `from components.economic_insights import EconomicInsights`  
3. ❌ `from components.view_enhancements import ViewEnhancer as ViewEnhancements`

### Why They Were Removed:
- These components were imported but never used anywhere in app.py
- They were causing unnecessary dependencies
- Removing them simplifies the import structure

## Verification:
- ✅ app.py compiles successfully without syntax errors
- ✅ No references to these components exist in the code
- ✅ File copied to OneDrive location

## Result:
The app.py file is now cleaner with only the imports that are actually used. This should resolve any import-related deployment issues for these unused components.

## Next Steps:
- Commit this change
- Move to Step 2: Create chart_wrapper.py component
