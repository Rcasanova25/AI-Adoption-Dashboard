🔍 First Impressions
Strengths:
Data-rich and credible: Excellent integration of trusted sources (Stanford AI Index 2025, McKinsey, OECD, Census).
User segmentation is thoughtful: Persona-based views (business leader, policymaker, researcher) show strong design intent.
The “Competitive Position Assessor” is standout: It’s the closest thing I’ve seen to turning AI adoption data into decision-grade intelligence.
Weaknesses:
Overwhelming density: The volume of charts and sections dilutes attention. I felt “data fatigue” midway through exploration.
Inconsistent visual design: Some pages feel polished, others look like raw data dumps. This hurts credibility.
Strategic narrative is buried: There’s powerful data here, but I had to dig for the story. As an executive, I want: “Here’s what it means for me.”
📊 General Takeaways
AI adoption is real and accelerating — but uneven by sector, firm size, and region.
Generative AI is driving a new wave of adoption far beyond traditional automation or analytics.
Cost of AI is collapsing, which has serious implications for market disruption, especially for SMEs and laggards.
High variance in ROI and maturity means many firms are likely misallocating or underutilizing AI investments.
Talent and governance gaps remain chronic bottlenecks despite growing awareness.
🧠 Specific Takeaways
Sector Gaps:
Tech, finance, and healthcare are nearing saturation.
Education and energy lag but show promise — suggesting potential investment targets or policy intervention points.
Firm Size Matters:
Firms <250 employees are essentially non-adopters (<15% adoption). This is both a risk and an opportunity.
Token Economics & Cost Trends:
A 280x reduction in token cost since 2022 fundamentally changes the feasibility of mass AI integration — and pricing models.
Productivity Impact by Skill Level:
Highest gains for low-skilled workers suggest AI could reduce inequality — if adoption is democratized.
Geographic Insights:
SF Bay Area’s dominance is expected — but the emergence of Nashville, San Antonio, and Las Vegas is surprising. This could inform expansion strategy or talent pipeline planning.
Governance + Risk:
While data privacy scores high in adoption, bias detection and transparency lag. There’s a real compliance and reputational risk gap.
❓ Key Questions After Reviewing
Where are the executive summaries?
Each section needs a short “what this means” box. I want 3 bullets: threat, opportunity, next step.
How do I benchmark my company vs competitors more easily?
The competitive position tool is great — but buried. This should be front and center on first load.
What’s the business case for investing now vs waiting 12 months?
I need clearer cost-of-inaction framing. Can you quantify risk exposure?
How does my vertical’s ROI compare to national averages?
ROI heatmaps by sector-function combo would help.
What’s the total cost of implementation?
You show model costs, but not full-stack implementation burden (personnel, retraining, consulting, infrastructure). That’s the real barrier.
How do I track change over time?
The dashboard feels static. A “last 12 months” vs “projected next 12 months” comparison mode would be valuable.
🧨 Brutal Honesty Summary
This dashboard is the best open-source attempt I’ve seen at translating AI adoption into economic and strategic intelligence.
But here’s the hard truth:
It’s trying to do everything for everyone, which makes it hard to quickly extract actionable insight.
It needs better prioritization, visual hierarchy, and storytelling for time-starved decision-makers.
The data is excellent, the UX/UI is functional, but the executive messaging is underdeveloped.
✅ Top 3 Fixes to Maximize Executive Value
Lead with strategic insights — For every view, add a 2–3 bullet "What this means for leaders" box.
Turn the Competitive Position Assessor into the homepage — It’s your best product.
Add ROI heatmaps and risk exposure forecasts — Executives need to weigh tradeoffs, not just see adoption rates.
