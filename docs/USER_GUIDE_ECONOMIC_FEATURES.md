## Enhanced ROI Calculator

### Overview
The ROI Analysis view now features a comprehensive financial calculator that goes beyond simple ROI to include NPV, IRR, TCO, and risk-adjusted returns.

### How to Use

1. **Navigate to ROI Analysis** → Click on "ROI Calculator" tab
2. **Enter Investment Parameters:**
   - Initial Investment: One-time implementation cost
   - Analysis Period: Number of years (1-10)
   - Annual Revenue Increase: Expected additional revenue
   - Annual Cost Savings: Expected efficiency gains
   - Annual Operating Cost: Ongoing costs

3. **Configure Risk & Context:**
   - Risk Level: Select from Low/Medium/High/Very High
   - Company Size: Used for benchmark comparisons
   - Primary Use Case: Main AI application area
   - Discount Rate: Your cost of capital (5-20%)

4. **Optional Productivity Analysis:**
   - Enable to calculate workforce productivity gains
   - Enter number of affected employees
   - Specify average salary and expected productivity gain

5. **Click "Calculate Comprehensive ROI"**

### Understanding Results

#### Financial Metrics Tab
- **NPV (Net Present Value)**: Value created after accounting for time value of money
  - Positive = Good investment
  - Negative = Investment destroys value
- **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**: Annualized return rate
  - Compare to your hurdle rate
- **Simple ROI**: Traditional ROI percentage
- **Payback Period**: Time to recover investment

#### TCO Analysis Tab
- **Total TCO**: Complete cost over analysis period
- **Breakdown**: Initial, operating, and maintenance costs
- **Annual TCO**: Average yearly cost

#### Risk Analysis Tab
- **Risk-Adjusted Return**: Return after accounting for risk
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Return per unit of risk (higher is better)
- **Risk Threshold**: Whether investment meets risk criteria

#### Benchmarks Tab
- **Industry Comparisons**: How your ROI compares to industry standards
- **Success Probability**: Based on company size and use case
- **Key Risk Factors**: Specific risks for your profile

## Scenario Analysis

### Overview
The Scenario Analysis view enables you to model uncertainty and explore different possible outcomes using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

1. **Set Base Case Parameters:**
   - Base Investment
   - Base Annual Benefit
   - Base Annual Cost
   - Analysis Period

2. **Define Uncertainty:**
   - Investment Uncertainty (±%)
   - Benefit Uncertainty (±%)
   - Cost Uncertainty (±%)
   - Select distribution type (Normal/Uniform)

3. **Run Simulation** (10,000 iterations)

4. **Interpret Results:**
   - **Probability Distribution**: Shows range of possible outcomes
   - **Confidence Intervals**: 90% of outcomes fall within these bounds
   - **Risk Metrics**: Probability of positive/negative NPV

### Sensitivity Analysis

1. **Select Variables to Analyze:**
   - Choose which parameters to test
   - Set variation range (typically ±20%)

2. **View Tornado Chart:**
   - Bars show impact of each variable
   - Longer bars = more sensitive
   - Use to identify critical factors

3. **Elasticity Values:**
   - Shows % change in output per % change in input
   - Values >1 indicate high sensitivity

### Adoption Curves

1. **Configure S-Curve Parameters:**
   - Maximum adoption rate
   - Time to reach inflection point
   - Steepness of adoption

2. **Model Different Scenarios:**
   - Conservative: Slow, gradual adoption
   - Base Case: Typical adoption pattern
   - Optimistic: Rapid adoption

3. **Use for Planning:**
   - Budget allocation over time
   - Resource planning
   - Expected benefit realization

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What discount rate should I use?**
A: Use your company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). If unknown, 10-12% is typical for most companies.

**Q: How do I model phased implementations?**
A: Use different cash flows for each year in the comprehensive calculator, starting with lower benefits in early years.

**Q: What's the difference between NPV and IRR?**
A: NPV shows dollar value created; IRR shows percentage return. Both should be positive for good investments.

**Q: How many Monte Carlo iterations are enough?**
A: The default 10,000 is sufficient for most analyses. Increase for critical decisions.

**Q: Should I include soft benefits?**
A: Yes, but be conservative. Employee satisfaction and brand value have real economic impact.
