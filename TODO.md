# Economics of AI Dashboard - TODO

## Current Task
- [x] Phase 1: Data Architecture - Create modular data loading system

## Completed  
- [x] Created base data loader interface and architecture
- [x] Implemented ALL data source loaders (12 total)
- [x] Created data models for validation
- [x] Set up data manager for orchestration
- [x] Added PDF processing dependencies
- [x] Created backward compatibility layer

## Next Steps
- [ ] Install PDF processing dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Update app.py to use new data loading system
- [ ] Phase 2: Economic Narrative - Add executive summaries and insights
- [ ] Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancement - Implement progressive disclosure
- [ ] Phase 4: Testing & Validation - Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Phase 5: Performance Optimization - Implement caching strategy

## Data Sources Integrated
✅ Stanford HAI AI Index Report 2025
✅ McKinsey State of AI Report
✅ Richmond Fed Productivity Analysis
✅ St. Louis Fed GenAI Analysis
✅ Goldman Sachs Economic Impact
✅ NVIDIA Token Economics
✅ OECD AI Policy Observatory
✅ IMF Economic Analysis
✅ Academic Papers Compilation
✅ AI Strategy Framework
✅ AI Use Case Catalog
✅ Public Sector Case Study

## Notes
- All hardcoded data has been replaced with modular loaders
- PDF extraction is stubbed - actual extraction will happen when dependencies are installed
- Dashboard maintains backward compatibility during transition
