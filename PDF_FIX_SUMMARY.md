# PDF Loading Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Directory Path Case Sensitivity
- **Fixed in**: `/config/settings.py`
- **Issue**: Settings used "AI Adoption Resources" (capital A) but actual directory is "AI adoption resources" (lowercase a)
- **Fix**: Changed to lowercase 'a' in settings

### 2. PDFExtractor Receiving Directory Instead of File Path
- **Fixed in**: `/data/loaders/oecd.py`
- **Issue**: Line 55 was passing `self.source.file_path` instead of `self.adoption_file` to PDFExtractor
- **Fix**: Changed to use correct file path variable

### 3. Incorrect Resource Path References
- **Fixed in**: `/data/loaders/oecd.py`
- **Issue**: Referenced "AI Adoption Resources 3" (capital A) instead of "AI adoption resources 3"
- **Fix**: Changed to lowercase 'a'

### 4. Malformed File Path in Goldman Sachs Loader
- **Fixed in**: `/data/loaders/goldman_sachs.py`
- **Issue**: Had concatenated path with .py file in the middle
- **Fix**: Changed to use settings.get_resources_path() with proper subdirectory

### 5. Demo Data Fallback Removed
- **Fixed in**: `/callbacks/data_callbacks.py`
- **Issue**: App was falling back to demo data when PDFs couldn't be loaded, violating CLAUDE.md requirements
- **Fix**: Removed all mock data creation and now raises RuntimeError with clear instructions

## Current Status

1. **PDF Files**: Confirmed present in correct directory
   - Location: `AI adoption resources/AI dashboard resources 1/`
   - 20 PDF files found and accessible

2. **Path Resolution**: All loaders now use correct case-sensitive paths

3. **Error Handling**: App now fails with clear error messages instead of using demo data

## Required for Full Functionality

1. Python packages must be installed:
   - pandas
   - PyMuPDF (fitz)
   - pdfplumber
   - tabula-py
   - PyPDF2

2. Java must be installed (required by tabula-py for table extraction)

3. PDF files must have read permissions

## Verification

The app will now:
- Attempt to load real data from PDFs
- If loading fails, show a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
- NOT fall back to demo/mock data (per CLAUDE.md requirements)

## Files Modified
1. `/config/settings.py` - Fixed case sensitivity
2. `/data/loaders/oecd.py` - Fixed file path references
3. `/data/loaders/goldman_sachs.py` - Fixed malformed path
4. `/callbacks/data_callbacks.py` - Removed demo data fallback
